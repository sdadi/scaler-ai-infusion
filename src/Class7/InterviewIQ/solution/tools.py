# tools.py -- INSTRUCTOR REFERENCE (fully implemented)
# ============================================================
#  Three rule-based evaluation "tools" the agent can call.
#  Each returns a structured dict (not a pre-formatted string) --
#  the agent decides how to present it to the model and uses the
#  raw numbers later for the final-report aggregation.
